I am a developer with a passion for software architecture, system design and programming languages. I have a solid scientific background and several years of technical experience with a software solution used by hundreds of companies. My experience encompasses various types of projects, from rapid and efficient proofs of concept to stable and robust software, and includes both individual and team projects, where I have served as both an executor and a decision-maker. I am also interested in user interface and experience issues, as well as product design. My key strengths are adaptability and analytical thinking.
